***NOTE***

Github was giving us issues. While trying to merge branches in order to submit the project, we got an error that we could not resolve. In the interest of time, we made a new Github repo, this is the one you are accessing currently.

Here is the error we could not resolve:
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
